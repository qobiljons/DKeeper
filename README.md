# `DKeeper`

Welcome to my `DKeeper` project! This project is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Internet Computer, leveraging the power of Motoko and React for a seamless, secure experience.

## Project Overview

This project serves as an example of how to integrate backend canisters with a modern frontend, utilizing the full capabilities of the Internet Computer. The frontend is styled with a Google Keep-like interface, ensuring a clean and intuitive user experience.

## Getting Started

To explore the project, start by examining the directory structure and configuration files. This setup is designed for easy development and deployment.

### Documentation

Before diving in, I recommend checking out these resources:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

### Key Commands

To get up and running, you might find these commands useful:

```bash
cd dkeeper/
dfx help
dfx canister --help


## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
